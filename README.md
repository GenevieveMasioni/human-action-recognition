# human-action-recognition
Human action recognition in photographs / still images

Versions:
- Keras using JupyterLab
- Matlab (obsolete)

## Motivation

Human action recognition is a standard Computer Vision problem and has been well studied in video interpretation/ understanding. But some actions in video are static by nature ("taking a photo") and only require recognition methods based on static cues. In this project, I propose an AI algorithm to recognize seven human actions using a photograph:
- Interacting with computer,
- Photographing,
- Playing Instrument,
- Riding Bike,
- Riding Horse,
- Running,
- Walking.
